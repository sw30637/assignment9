Findings of Assignment 9 plots

It is interesting to see plots for all 5 boroughs are pretty similar.
Even though the qualify of large number of restaurant remain same, 
it is shown that there are larger number of restaurants which quality are getting worse than improving with an exception of Bronx. 

There are restaurants in Brooklyn and Manhattan which the ratings have been decreased three steps down, and this information and the reasons should be known to public.

In final project (I am working with Kevin), we are planning to address this issue.
