Problem 5(B): What conclusion can you draw about grades?

According to the graphs, the majority of restaurants have an A health rating,
and that majority is increasing over time.

In terms of specific periods, during Sep 2011 to Apr 2012, the number of 
restaurants with an A rating increased rapidly. On the other hand, the number of 
restaurants graded B and C have stayed stable by comparison from 2012 until now.
The trends of the five Boroughs are very similar to each others, with very large 
growth in all 5  (although the levels are still quite different across
the Boroughs, with ~9,000 restaurants in Manhattan and only ~850 in Staten 
Isand. 

On a whole, it seems as if resutarant grades have by and large been improving 
over the time window examined in this exercise. This could suggest that 
restuarants are responsive to the evaluations and have since improved their 
saftey and health standards. 

Problem 6: 

Some other information that could prove useful in this data:

- Looking at health rating by cuisine, to see if there are any trends to be
found which cuisines tend to have more violations. 

- Growth in number of restaurant by borough, zipcode, etc.

- Popularity of different types of cuisine, and how these 
preferences change over time.

While this data does contain helpful information on the health ratings of these
restaunts, it doesn't contain information on the quality of the food served
at these restaurants (in terms of the quailty of the cuisine itself). Because
it lacks this information, for a given grade, it might be difficult to decide 
on which resutarants to patronize given only this data.
