'''
The main module for assignment 9. The data is read in using the CleanData 
method in the RestaurantData class. Coming up with the measure of 
restaurants' progress over time is done in the TestRestaurantGrades module. 
The Graphs are created using the GenerateGraphs function in the GenerateGraphs 
module.
